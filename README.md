[00:05.59] A hundred days have made me older
[00:09.22] Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
[00:18.73] A thousand lies have made me colder
[00:22.78] And I don't think I can look at this the same
[00:45.28] 
[00:33.95] But all the miles that separate
[00:40.74] Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face
[01:02.74] 
[00:47.40] I'm here without you, baby
[00:50.49] But you're still on my lonely mind
[00:53.92] I think about you, baby
[00:57.08] And I dream about you all the time
[01:14.08] 
[01:00.65] I'm here without you, baby
[01:03.82] But you're still with me in my dreams
[01:09.21] And tonight it's only you and me, yeah
[01:28.21] 
[01:26.42] The miles just keep rollin'
[01:29.59] As the people leave their way to say hello
[01:39.17] I've heard this life is overrated
[01:42.95] But I hope that it gets better as we go, oh yeah, yeah
[02:09.95] 
[01:53.84] I'm here without you, baby
[01:57.31] But you're still on my lonely mind
[02:00.45] I think about you, baby
[02:03.50] And I dream about you all the time
[02:20.50] 
[02:07.38] I'm here without you, baby
[02:10.76] But you're still with me in my dreams
[02:16.08] And tonight, girl, it's only you and me
[02:35.58] 
[02:21.04] Everything I know, and anywhere I go (Oh whoa)
[02:27.58] It gets hard but it won't take away my love (Oh whoa)
[02:34.02] And when the last one falls
[02:37.45] When it's all said and done
[02:40.97] It gets hard but it won't take away my love, whoa, oh, oh
[03:09.47] 
[03:03.91] I'm here without you, baby
[03:07.35] But you're still on my lonely mind
[03:10.55] I think about you, baby
[03:13.73] And I dream about you all the time
[03:30.73] 
[03:17.48] I'm here without you, baby
[03:20.44] But you're still with me in my dreams
[03:26.09] And tonight, girl, it's only you and me, yeah
[03:35.93] Oh girl, oh oh
