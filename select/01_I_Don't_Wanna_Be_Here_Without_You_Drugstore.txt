There was a time when we were young and true
We used to have so many points of view
We used to lie on the ground, kiss in the rain
The world outside kept looking in

You've got a job you said it was for me
But somehow things turned out so differently
We never lie on the ground or kiss in the rain
I don't wanna stay another day

I don't wanna be here without you another day

The kitchen clock is hitting half past three
Outside the world is looking happy
Funny how it can change, sunshine to rain
I don't wanna spend another day

I don't wanna be here without you another day

There was a time when we were young and true
We never do the things we used to do
Funny how it can change, love into pain
I don't wanna spend another day

I don't wanna be here without you another day
